# LiteraryLoop---Online-Book-Buying-and-Exchanging-Platform
The project, Literary Loop, is an online platform for book enthusiasts, offering book exchange, buying, and selling services in a secure environment. The platform provides distinct user roles such as unregistered users, registered users, members, and administrators, each with specific privileges.

Key Features:

Membership System: Admins oversee and approve memberships, ensuring a secure community.
Book Exchange & Sales: Members can exchange books, while registered users can sell and buy books through a user-friendly system.
Admin Tools: Admins manage book listings, exchanges, and maintain an organized book inventory.
Secure Transactions: The platform integrates secure payment options, safeguarding user information.
User Support: A "Contact Us" page helps users submit inquiries and get assistance.
The Waterfall model was chosen for development, ensuring a clear, structured approach. The system offers functional requirements like user authentication, book management, and secure transactions, while non-functional requirements emphasize usability, security, and scalability.
